Final Project for the front end engineering course at The Iron Yard Atlanta.

SummerBreak is a parent (and teen) approved website that offers teens opportunities in the Greater Atlanta Area over the summer. Once registered with us, anyone can add an event, but the event goes into 24-hour approval process to be reviewed by an administrator. All events are real, in Atlanta, and teen/family friendly.

**Angular1** framework used for the front end and **Node.JS** with **SQL** and **PosGres** on the back end. Routes tested on **Postman**.
